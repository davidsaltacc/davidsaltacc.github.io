[[[[[[[what i made?
[[[[[[[[some giant tree mod
[[[[[[[[a mod with all random shit and just progress in modding
[[[[[[[[modded in my friends models
[[[[[[[[a hack client
[[[[[[[[[its titled "ShadowClient" for some reason it was the first thing i came up with and didnt exist alr
[[[[[[[[[its really just a fabric mod
[[[[[[[[[it has a few features
[[[[[[[[[[a clickgui
[[[[[[[[[[a few modules
[[[[[[[[[[[ye im not gon put a whole list here-
[[[[[[[[[[[[in order of development:
[[[[[[[[[[[[[auto sprint
[[[[[[[[[[[[[spider
[[[[[[[[[[[[[[you can climb up walls
[[[[[[[[[[[[[step up
[[[[[[[[[[[[[[you can step up blocks w/o jumping
[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[up to 10 block
[[[[[[[[[[[[[auto swim
[[[[[[[[[[[[[fly
[[[[[[[[[[[[[auto fish
[[[[[[[[[[[[[auto crits
[[[[[[[[[[[[[[automatically crit
[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[for some reason only works when youre not moving
[[[[[[[[[[[[[anti knockback
[[[[[[[[[[[[[auto respawn
[[[[[[[[[[[[[camera noclip
[[[[[[[[[[[[[[in f5 mode you can move your camera into walls
[[[[[[[[[[[[[faster climb
[[[[[[[[[[[[[airjump
[[[[[[[[[[[[[[you can jump in the air
[[[[[[[[[[[[[no fall damage
[[[[[[[[[[[[[parkour
[[[[[[[[[[[[[[on ledges, automatically jump
[[[[[[[[[[[[[powdered snow walk
[[[[[[[[[[[[[[walk on powdered snow without leather boots
[[[[[[[[[[[[[tracers
[[[[[[[[[[[[[[draws a line to every entity in render distance
[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[customizable which entities
[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[the lines are also colored btw
[[[[[[[[[[[[[fast break
[[[[[[[[[[[[[timer
[[[[[[[[[[[[[[speeds up the entire game (only client side)
[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[makes you be able to run faster (server doesnt tp u back)
[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[because you send more movement packets it seems normal to the server
[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[tho sometimes you can send too much and get tped back
[[[[[[[[[[[[[esp
[[[[[[[[[[[[[[renders an outline around every entity in render distance
[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[customizable exactly like tracers
[[[[[[[[[[[[[enderman magnet
[[[[[[[[[[[[[[looks at any not angry enderman in your area
[[[[[[[[[[[[[secret shaders
[[[[[[[[[[[[[[so mojang implemented a few shaders into the games code
[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[the shaders are unused but pretty cool
[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[i use the FXAA shader when normally playing myself
[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[it basically just improves rendering of things far in the distance
[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[it really makes the game look better
[[[[[[[[[[[[[sneak spam 
[[[[[[[[[[[[[[spams sneak
[[[[[[[[[[[[[derpy
[[[[[[[[[[[[[[(only visible to other players) you just turn your head around like crazy
[[[[[[[[[[[[[no hurt tilt
[[[[[[[[[[[[[[when you get hurt your camera doesnt get tilt
[[[[[[[[[[[[[panic
[[[[[[[[[[[[[[disables all modules
[[[[[[[[[[[[[rainbow gui
[[[[[[[[[[[[[[makes the gui rainbow
[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[why?
[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[why not
[[[[[[[[[[[[[no/lower fire overlay
[[[[[[[[[[[[[[makes the fire overlay lower, or completely invisible.
[[[[[[[[[[[[[auto crystal detonate
[[[[[[[[[[[[[[does detonate all crystals in reach (not place)
[[[[[[[[[[[[[bhopping
[[[[[[[[[[[[[[you jump when running so youre faster
[[[[[[[[[[[[[disable hack updates
[[[[[[[[[[[[[[disables all client updates, which can help with lag
[[[[[[[[[[[[[disable welcome message
[[[[[[[[[[[[[[disables the welcome message showed when you join a world
[[[[[[[[[[[[[no water push
[[[[[[[[[[[[[[prevents water from pushing you
